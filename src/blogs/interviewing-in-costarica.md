# Interviewing in Costa Rica

August 1, 2022

I miss home. Period. And I've been trying to architect my return in the best way possible. So I started interviewing with tech companies in Costa Rica to get a feeling for what's the market out there, and how do I fit in within it. All while about to start a new job in a hedge fund :)

I'm a software engineer that has been abroad for 8 years already. 4 of uni, and 4 for work. My parents are in Costa Rica, I've kept close with my best friends from high school, and my girlfriend is there too. Apart from that, everytime I'd go back to Costa Rica for at least a month. And after all that, you get this feeling of: *Why do I even come back to the UK?* To the bad weather, to the pretentious people, the extremely expensive life, the unhealthy living standards, and seeing sad people in the train every day.

I found myself in a moment whether I didn't know whether I just wanted to do a check mark on having been accepted in a secretive hedge fund and leave. Thought to myself: *maybe MSFT can give me a monster offer and I just go home*. But that didn't happen.

## My goals for interviewing

Anyway, my goal was to test a few things:

1. Would I be able to find any similar jobs to what I do?
2. Would they understand my background? aka value Goldman Sachs? or even the international experience?
3. Am I senior to them?
4. What are the salaries like?
5. What are the cenicientas in Costa Rica?


## Challenges

### My industry doesn't really exist in Costa Rica

Yes, I'm a software engineer/developer, probably like yourself if you're reading this. But I'm quite passionate about Finance. 

Finance pays pretty well, and it's like a parallel industry to #BigTech. Where they're constantly hiring software people to handle they're huge systems and try to innovate to beat their competitors in any way possible. The best paid engineers are those building the stuff around trading (everything around trading strategies) and also the subsecond highly optimized trading execution platforms. Not doing support, and not doing contracting. 

Also these engineers end up building a lot finance knowledge around the teams the work with. So it's likely that you'll meet engineers that know a lot about bonds, or equities, or swaps, or fx, and that adds value **if you stay within the industry**. And we do bits of everything: we do QA, we do System Design, we do Project Management, we do DevOps, we do Excel and PPT if we have to. And by the way, it's more likely for us to feel SCRUM is complete shit. 

In my previous job, we'd manage the assets of many big pension funds, and big companies for the long term (I'll write more about this on the post on **What's Asset Management**). The volume of money and trading in the firm forced it to be heavily reliant in technology, and thus we had a big impact on the PnL of the firm (as a cost mostly). We would manage absurds amount of money but don't trade as much. 

In my current job, we don't manage nearly as much money, but we charge the investors absurdely more fees for it :) (I'll write more about this on the post on **What's a Hedge Fund**). We manage less money (still more than $10bn), yet we now trade billions a day. All automatic. All strategies are algorithms and math. Nobody decides when to buy something or sell, the algorithms do. So naturally since we use a lot of tech and data to figure out what to buy, we also use even more to actually execute that in the best way possible. 

Anyway, there's some of BigTech in Costa Rica with Amazon, and recently MSFT which is now giving stock compensation. But there is no real presence of Finance (Asset Management/Trading/Hedge Funds) companies that rely mostly on technology. I mean there's trading firms and Bolsa de Valores but most of the work is actually *over the counter* (someone calls someone else and they strike a deal and then they trade it). I don't expect that to change cause the rush for talent in hedge funds is mostly in the US, and UK, and Hong Kong.

So I could aspire for jobs in BAC San Jose maybe around credit risk technology and etcera, but it's not really the same.

Also could aspire for Citi, which is *technically* a direct competitor of Goldman Sachs (my previous employer). But they don't have any similar tech jobs in Costa Rica. They have mostly around security and support. 

### Ok, but they at least value my reputation right?

Well if I can't find an equivalent, maybe my CV can have a big weight because of the big names in it. I'm an NYU graduate, and I work at Goldman Sachs, the bank that accepts less than 3% of its applicants. 

Well no.

Nobody knows Goldman Sachs in Costa Rica. Even my coworkers at Banco Popular where like: *"what's that? ah blessings"* Bro... how do you work in an investment bank handling pensions and you don't know the Blackrocks and the GSAMs of the world. 


### No master's degree

Degrees are important. Traditional paths like lots of educations and certifications are important. And I don't have a master's so that doesn't help either.

### No certifications

In Costa Rica because of the nature of the business that reaches there, certifications are super important. If you're selling consulting services, support, or trying to be the best mercenary out there, you gotta bring the specialists in those specific tasks. And guess what, I don't do ITIL, Azure, AWS, CISCO, none of that.

### The salary HIT!

Current salary is £10,600k a month (~$12,500) plus a big phat bonus at year end, with potential to duplicate the overall yearly compensation in a few years. And in Costa Rica I'd go to maybe $4,200 becuase I'm not even senior cause of my years of experience. 

Although to be fair, taxes in Costa Rica are pretty low (yes, you hear me right. 25% is a joke), and cost of living is much better. So lifestyle wise I would be even better, but forget about both investing heavily while traveling multiple times during the year and those luxuries.

Some data points if ever useful:

1. Salaries for juniors (ex. MSFT): $4200-$5000
2. Salaries for seniors (ex. MSFT): $5000-$6500
3. Salaries for leads (ex. MSFT): $6500-$7500
4. Salaries in MSFT for juniors (almost mid developers): I know 2: 3.200.000 and 2.800.000 -plus stock options and cash bonuses which puts them at similar level with the seniors in other tech companies in Costa Rica


### Don't even know my title 

Whenever you look at jobs in Costa Rica you'll see titles like QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer, System Architech, Junior Developer, Project Manager, and my favorite: Scrum Master!

Man Idk, I do a bit of all that. Can I just be "software engineer" and be responsible for at least testing my own code? I found only Microsoft, Amazon, and SMASH follow this structure. Amazon and MSFT that's expected.

And I have no fucking clue of what my seniority is. I was given lots of responsibility at Goldman and built a few things from the grown up. Had lots of tech and business responsibilities and they worked my ass off. So naturally I had some hopes of jumping at least a level to Senior? I was an Associate performing at Vice President level (in finance that means a mid developer performing as a Senior)


## The Good

### A couple of cenicientas 

A cenicienta for me is that company that doesn't go around using work life balance, remote work, and a nice culture as their main selling point. Cenicientas are the guys that make you work your ass off and only get the best of the best, and they give you the chances to grow if you're worth it. The same way a top investment bank pulls the best talent from an average tech company, and then the hedge fund pulls them out of those top banks and tells them: *hey you want money? They work ... No Scrum, no $300 vouchers to invest in a desk and a chair, not paying for your wifi at home, none of that*.

I'm moving back to Costa Rica to rebuild my life at just 26 years old. I wanna go work my ass off... and get good experiences, projections, and good money out of it. Dude, I don't want to go and have just "fun" for $5000 - $6000 a month. 

Make me work like a doctor. I'm used to it. And also pay me like one.

Anyway, enough entitled ranting. I found two:

1. Microsoft. They pay junior people as much as the other tech companies (ex. Amazon) pay their senior ones...

2. AppOmni. This a SanFran startup that had just raised funding and were ready to splash. They were one of SMASH's clients. 

I never interviewed with MSFT, cause Idk... didn't feel like it was time if I just wanted to explore. Usually if you fail an interview these companies put you in a blacklist for some time ranging from 6 months to 2 years.

And with AppOmni they wanted a DJANGO expert... Again, they come to Costa Rica looking for the experts. Cause it's easier to contract those guys. 

### Some recruiters are great

People from SMASH and one of the guys of Gorilla were incredibly helpful. They would talk openly about salaries like I've never seen before. 

Specially the guy from SMASH, he really cared about finding my best fit, and helping close the gaps in my CV. Kuddos to Sergio.


## The Bad

### Some recruiters are awful

There was this recruiter in a company I'd rather not name. She literally wouldn't stop talking, yet never have an answer. She was also the only one that didn't give me any info on salaries.

### Nobody knows anything about what I do here

Nobody knows Goldman Sachs, nobody knows what a hedge fund is, nobody knows what Venture Capital is, nobody knows what it takes to work in New York, London, Abu Dhabi, etc.

I'm just a developer with good english. Which is fair, but I didn't go through everything I've been through to be happy with that. And thruth is I just have to find the right people that can value me.

### Interview process is so different 

The interviews in Costa Rica are about what you know, the more senior the more you're meant to know. And the longer the list of technologies you should have in your CV.

There's no pair programming, no hard leetcode shit flying around, no system design and all that jazz. Which to be honest it's great, cause that takes lots of time and anxiety. But also makes me wonder about the quality of some of the work, and how much these guys leave to experience and luck and bullshiting in interviews by the developer.

**It's no wonder that most people get downleveled so badly when they apply to MSFT. And still take it cause it's a raise anyway lol.**

### Some companies have no clear IC tracks

An IC is an individual contributor. And there are tracks in most companies so that a very good developer doesn't have to go into management, because not everyone is meant to go into management. 

I asked about that track in a few companies and they were like *no, I mean you gotta grow your organization if you want to grow as a person*. That's not great.

### Companies are project rather than product oriented

The above comment about companies not having IC tracks makes sense unfortunately given that most companies in Costa Rica give services to third parties. Therefore, the software/the final product is never as deep and most importantly is never owned by the Costa Rican company. 

For example: if Gorilla builds an app for an insurance company in the US, who owns the app? Does Gorilla get to keep something when the contract is done? Nope. There's a lot of **project** management, but no **product** management. There's no grow the product mentality. 

What's worse of all, Gorilla cannot take the app and sell it to someone else. The model doesn't scale as well, and thus the margins are lower, the salaries are lower, and the people they need are not necesarily long term minded people that you can't replace.

Similar issues happen in Consulting. That's why Mckinsey, BCG, Deloitte, ... will never pay as much as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Facebook, Google, ... The Mckinsey analyst did hours and hours of work, presents the report and goes home with a payment. And then that analyst has to go do the whole thing again from scratch for another company.

### A bad interview experience

This mtfs ... Ok here's the chronic:

1. Do this online test. I score a 92 (it had some SCRUM bullshit btw, agh...)
1. Recruiter calls. Cristhian your test is so good, we're gonna move you to the next stage
1. Next interview is 1h and a half, at midning London time, cause the asswholes couldn't schedule any earlier.
1. The interview: *your test is pretty good and we don't need to talk about technical stuff. We'll cover your previous mentoring opportunities and the people you had in change.*
1. Me: *damn... I might even go for lead?* 
1. Recruiter: *we've placed you as mid becuase of your technical skills. The salary is $4200, are you interested?*
1. What the fuck.... technical skills, you guys didn't even want to interview that. So I ask: *Can you provide more feedback? I heard the complete opposite the whole interview process*
1. Recruiter: *The interviewer said you should work more on [Cloud](/blog?post=aws-first-steps). and system design* 
1. Thank you. 

I mean they downleveled me based on something they didn't even want to test because they were sure was fine?...

Later on I've heard they've done that to a few people. I guess it's an usual strategy to bring you on board, promote you quickly, and then keep you at the new level for the next few years. That way your salary is within a lower band but you're "motivated" cause *hey! the company promoted me quickly, they must think I'm a great resource that came and proved him/herself.*


## Final thoughts

Before heading out I want to thank my friends.

Life takes a lot of twists. When I was in high school I was the best student, going out in TV interviews, having Informe11 in my home once (no Galán tho :( ), getting a lot of prices, killing it in exams with no effort. Some of my friends I think genuinely appreciated that, and some needed my help in projects and exams.

But now, I'm the guy asking all of my friends for help, guys that could perfectly be my bosses this day. They're all doing pretty well for themselves and they helped me reach the rigth people multiple times and gave me lots of insights as to what their companies and journeys have been like.  

God bless you lads!

Anyway, **I'm not going home any time soon :(** Doesn't work for me yet. I knew that it was going to be hard, and that it will hit in many ways to return. It's gonna have to be a very well architected project. 

The important thing is to get closer and closer to knowing the rules of the game. 

In the meantime, I'm actually having a lot of fun in [WorldQuant](https://www.worldquant.com/). More on this in my post on [What is a hedge fund](/blog?post=what-is-a-hedge-fund).
