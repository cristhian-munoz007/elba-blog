# Interviewing in Costa Rica

August 31, 2022

I miss home. And I've been trying to architect my return in the best way possible. So I started interviewing with tech companies in Costa Rica to get a feeling for what's the market out there, and how do I fit in. All while about to start a new job in a hedge fund :)

I'm a software engineer that has been abroad for 8 years already. 4 for university, and 4 for work. My parents are in Costa Rica, I've kept a close relationship with my best friends from high school, and my girlfriend is there too. Everytime I'd go back to Costa Rica for at least 2 weeks, on average a month, and thanks to COVID 2 months and half once. 

After trips like that you get this feeling of: *Why do I even come back to the UK?* To the bad weather, to the pretentious people, the extremely expensive life, the unhealthy living standards, and seeing sad people in the train every day.

I've never really been an adult in Costa Rica, so it's possible I land there and hate it very soon after. But being abroad makes you appreciate your country a lot more. 

I found myself in a moment whether I didn't know whether I just wanted to do a check mark of having been accepted in a secretive hedge fund and leave. Thought to myself: *maybe MSFT can give me a monster offer and I just go home*. But that didn't happen.

## My goals for interviewing

Anyway, my goal was to test a few things:

1. Would I be able to find any similar jobs to what I do?
2. Would they understand my background? aka value Goldman Sachs? or even the international experience?
3. Am I senior?
4. What are the salaries like?
5. What are the cenicientas in Costa Rica?

I didn't have high expectations to any of the above, but I'm glad I confirmed a bunch of things. I knew it was going to be hard to make sense of this.

## Challenges

### My industry doesn't really exist in Costa Rica

Yes, I'm a software engineer/developer, probably like yourself if you're reading this. But I'm quite passionate about Finance. 

Finance pays pretty well, and it's like a parallel industry to **#BigTech**. Where they're constantly hiring software people to handle their huge systems and try to innovate to beat their competitors in any way possible. The best paid engineers are those building the stuff around trading (everything around trading strategies), the subsecond highly optimized trading execution platforms, and those that can get very close to the actual business and have a quick turnaround. Not the ones doing support, nor doing infrastructure, nor keeping the shop running, and most likely not doing contracting. 

Also these engineers end up building a lot finance knowledge around the teams the work with. So it's likely that you'll meet engineers that know a lot about bonds, or equities, or swaps, or fx, and that adds value **if you stay within the industry**. And we do bits of everything: we do QA, we do System Design, we do Project Management, we do DevOps, we do Excel and PPT if we have to. And by the way, it's more likely for us to feel SCRUM is complete shit. 

The culture is pretty different from tech tho. It's *shittier*, we work more, and we get pay big time based on a year end bonus. Last year my bonus was around 40% of my total compensation, and if you quit before it's announced you will get nothing. Meaning that if I had quit a month earlier, I would have missed out on £50,000. So you have to be really smart when you decide to leave, negotiate a lot, and be ready to take a hit in that year.

In my previous job, we'd manage the assets of many big pension funds, and big companies for the long term (I'll write more about this on the post on **What's Asset Management**). The volume of money and trading in the firm forced it to be heavily reliant in technology, and thus we had a big impact on the PnL of the firm (as a cost mostly). We would manage absurds amount of money (close to trillions) but don't trade as much. 

In my current job, we don't manage nearly as much money, but we charge the investors absurdely more fees for it :) (I'll write more about this on the post on **What's a Hedge Fund**). We manage less money (still more than $10bn), yet we now trade billions a day. All automatic. All strategies are algorithms and math. Nobody decides when to buy something or sell, the algorithms do. So naturally since we use a lot of tech and data to figure out what to buy, we also use even more to actually execute that in the best way possible. Believe or not, this is a much proffitable business even if the Assets under Management (AUM) is a lot smaller.

Anyway, there's some of BigTech in Costa Rica with Amazon, and recently MSFT which is now giving stock compensation. But there is no real presence of Finance (Asset Management/Trading/Hedge Funds) companies that rely mostly on technology. I mean there's trading firms and la Bolsa de Valores but most of the work is actually *over the counter* (someone calls someone else and they strike a deal and then they trade it). I don't expect that to change cause the rush for talent in hedge funds is mostly in the US, and UK, and Hong Kong.

So I could aspire for jobs in BAC San Jose maybe around credit risk technology and etcera, but it's not really the same.

Also could aspire for Citi, which is *technically* a direct competitor of Goldman Sachs (my previous employer). But they don't have any similar tech jobs in Costa Rica. They have mostly around security and support. 

### Ok, but they at least value my reputation right?

Well if I can't find an equivalent, maybe my CV can have a big weight because of the big names in it. I'm an NYU graduate, and I work at Goldman Sachs, the bank that accepts less than 3% of its applicants. 

Well no.

Nobody knows Goldman Sachs in Costa Rica. Even my coworkers at Banco Popular where like: *"what's that? ah blessings"* Bro... how do you work in a bank of that importance, handling pensions, and you don't know the Blackrocks and the GSAMs of the world. 

### No master's degree

Degrees are important. Traditional paths like lots of educations and certifications are important. And I don't have a master's so that doesn't help either.

### No certifications

In Costa Rica because of the nature of the business that reaches there, certifications are super important. If you're selling consulting services, support, or trying to be the best mercenary out there, you gotta bring the specialists in those specific tasks. And guess what, I don't do ITIL, Azure, AWS, CISCO, none of that.

### The salary hit?

Current salary is £10,600k a month (~$12,500) plus hopefully a big phat bonus starting next year, with potential to duplicate the overall yearly compensation in a few years. I had no idea what to expect, because I have heard that people were very happy and doctors being like *my brother makes more than me!* ok dude...

Whatever it was I knew it could not be that great though compared to the potential here in a few years.

### Don't even know my title 

Whenever you look at jobs in Costa Rica you'll see titles like QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer, System Architech, Junior Developer, Project Manager, and my favorite: Scrum Master!

Man Idk, I do a bit of all that. Can I just be "software engineer" and be responsible for at least testing my own code? I found only Microsoft, Amazon, and SMASH (depending on the client) follow this structure. Amazon and MSFT that's expected.

### No clue on seniority 

And I have no fucking clue of what my seniority is. I was given lots of responsibility at Goldman and built a few things from the grown up, sometimes at the expense of highly technical work though. I had lots of tech and business responsibilities, even managed people in a way, and they worked my ass off. So naturally I had some hopes of jumping at least a level to Senior? I was an Associate performing at Vice President level (in finance that means a mid developer performing as a Senior) since 2021.

I have heard of senior devs being placed at juniors in MSFT (level 59 and 60). I was an Associate at Goldman Sachs so if you look at the table in [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Microsoft,Goldman%20Sachs,Facebook,Amazon&track=Software%20Engineer) I was between 62 and 62. 

## The process

Alright so I reached out to friends that helped me in two ways mostly. They refered me to companies so that I could minimize the sample set of the best ones known out there, and they also told me a bit about their salaries.

Chatted with friends in GFT, Gorilla, SMASH, Citi, Encora, Microsoft, and Experian.

I reached out to most of the companies mostly with the idea of networking. However, they simply made me interview. I didn't reach out to Experian because my brother works for them, so I felt I should only approaach that company in a more serious note.

Ended up speaking/interviewing with: GFT, Gorilla, and SMASH. IBM ghosted me. Reached out to CITI, but nothing there interesting. Couldn't interview with Amazon because I had just dropped an interview process with them in the UK. With Microsfot, I tried talking to recruiters to network, but they weren't really helpful: *just find a job you like and apply*. Alright, fine.  

This is what I found.

## The Good

### A couple of cenicientas 

A cenicienta for me is that company that doesn't go around using work life balance, remote work, and a nice culture as their main selling point. Cenicientas are the guys that make you work your ass off and only get the best of the best, and they give you the chances to grow if you're worth it. The same way a top investment bank pulls the best talent from an average tech company, and then the hedge fund pulls them out of those top banks and tells them: *hey you want money? Then work ... No Scrum, no $300 vouchers to invest in a desk and a chair, not paying for your wifi at home, none of that. Just a big risk, and a big promise.*

I'm moving back to Costa Rica to rebuild my life at just 26 years old. I wanna go work my ass off... and get good experiences, projections, and good money out of it. I don't want to go and have just "fun" and an easy "adjustment" for $5000 - $6000 a month. 

Make me work 60-80 hours a week if you have to. I'm used to it.

Anyway, enough entitled ranting. I found two:

1. Microsoft. Just because their pay is superior, and they're growing a lot. They ay junior people as much as the other tech companies (ex. Amazon) pay their senior ones...

2. AppOmni. This a SanFran startup that had just raised funding and were ready to splash. They were one of SMASH's clients, and they were rejecting candidates left and right. I assume their interview process is more like that of big tech, with the very difficult leetcode and etc. 

I never interviewed with MSFT, cause Idk... didn't feel like it was time if I just wanted to explore. Usually if you fail an interview these companies put you in a blacklist for some time ranging from 6 months to 2 years.

And with AppOmni they wanted a DJANGO expert... Again, they come to Costa Rica looking for the experts. Cause it's easier to contract those guys. 

### Some recruiters are great

People from SMASH and one of the guys of Gorilla were incredibly helpful. They would talk openly about salaries like I've never seen before. 

Specially the guy from SMASH, he really cared about finding my best fit, and helping close the gaps in my CV. Kuddos to Sergio.


## The Bad


### Nobody knows anything about what I do here

Nobody knows Goldman Sachs, nobody knows what a hedge fund is, nobody knows what Venture Capital is, nobody knows what it takes to work in New York, London, Abu Dhabi, etc.

I'm just a developer with good English. Which is fair, but I would like to think that it is a bit more complex than that. Maybe I'm a pretentious asswhole, maybe it's just out of dignity. 

Truth is I just have to find the right people that can value me.

### Some recruiters are awful

There was this recruiter in a company I'd rather not name. She literally wouldn't stop talking, yet never have an answer. She was also the only one that didn't give me any info on salaries. *You have to give me a number first* How?! I don't live in Costa Rica, I don't have a currently Costa Rican salary to compare, ...

### Interview process is so different 

The interviews in Costa Rica are about what you know, the more senior the more you're meant to know. And the longer the list of technologies you should have in your CV. The online tests had lots of multiple choice questions for example.

There's no pair programming, no hard leetcode shit flying around, no system design and all that jazz. Which to be honest it's great, cause that takes lots of time and anxiety. But also makes me wonder where these guys put the weight when evaluating an engineer, and how much is left to experience and bullshiting in interviews.

It's no wonder that most people get down-leveled so badly when they apply to MSFT. And still take it cause it's a raise anyway lol.

### Some companies have no clear IC tracks

IC stands for **Individual Contributor**. And there are tracks in most companies so that a very good developer doesn't have to go into management, because not everyone is meant to go into management. 

I asked about that track in a few companies and they were like *no, I mean you gotta grow your organization if you want to grow as a person*. That's not great.

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt, because that came from recruiters and I know most of them don't work with people at all levels.

### Companies are project rather than product oriented

The above comment about companies not having IC tracks makes sense unfortunately given that most companies in Costa Rica give services to third parties. Therefore, the software/the final product is never as deep and most importantly is never owned by the Costa Rican company. 

For example: if Gorilla builds an app for an insurance company in the US, who owns the app? Does Gorilla get to keep something when the contract is done? Nope. There's a lot of **project** management, but no **product** management. There's no grow the product into further scale. 

What's worse of all, Gorilla cannot take the app and sell it to someone else. The business model doesn't scale as well, and thus the margins are lower, the salaries are lower, and the people they need are not necesarily long term minded people that you can't replace.

If you want more revenue, you need more contracts, but also more developers. Product oriented tech companies only need to seel the same thing, but to more clients. 

Similar issues happen in Consulting. That's why Mckinsey, BCG, Deloitte, ... will never pay as much as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Facebook, Google, ... The Mckinsey analyst did hours and hours of work, presents the report and goes home with a payment. And then that analyst has to go do the whole thing again from scratch for another company.

### A bad interview experience

These mtfs ... Ok here's the chronic:

1. Do this online test. I score a 92 (it had some SCRUM bullshit btw, agh...)
1. Recruiter calls. Cristhian your test is so good, we're gonna move you to the next stage
1. Next interview is 1h and a half, at midning London time, cause the senior developer in Colombia couldn't schedule any earlier.
1. The interview: *your test is pretty good and we don't need to talk about technical stuff. We'll cover your previous mentoring opportunities and the people you had in change.*
1. Me: *damn... I might even go for lead?* 
1. Recruiter: *we've placed you as mid becuase of your technical skills. The salary is $4200, are you interested?*
1. What the fuck... technical skills?, the guys didn't even want to interview that. So I ask: *Can you provide more feedback? I heard the complete opposite the whole interview process*
1. Recruiter: *The interviewer said you should work more on CI/CD, Containerization and Orchestration, [Cloud](/blog?post=aws-first-steps), and system design* 
1. Thank you. 

I understand I'm not senior. I can take that with all the peace, however it left me a pretty bitter taste:

I mean they downleveled me based on something they didn't even want to test at first because they were sure was fine?... 

Yes I know nothing about the Cloud, and I don't have the usual amount of years of experience needed (5 to 7, and I'm at 4), but I've done a fair amount of system design at work already, lots of K8s, and I was ready to take any questions. But they did none!

Also, why do they want you to have it all if they have specific people for DevOps, Cloud, etc ...?

Later on I've heard they've done that to a few people. I guess it's an usual strategy to bring you on board, promote you quickly, and then keep you at the new level for the next few years. That way your salary is within a lower band but you're "motivated" cause *hey! the company promoted me quickly, they must think I'm a great resource that came and proved him/herself.*


### The salary HIT!

Based on the above, in Costa Rica I'd go to maybe **$4,200** becuase I'm not even senior cause of my years of experience. That's a good salary, don't get me wrong. But not sure I'm comfortable.

Although to be fair, taxes in Costa Rica are pretty low (yes, you hear me right. 25% is a joke), and cost of living is much better, so lifestyle-wise I would be even better. However, forget about both investing heavily while traveling multiple times during the year and those luxuries. And forget about 20%/30% increases year over year.

Some data points if ever useful:

1. Salaries for juniors (ex. MSFT): $4200-$5000
2. Salaries for seniors (ex. MSFT): $5000-$6500
3. Salaries for leads (ex. MSFT): $6500-$7500
4. Salaries in MSFT for juniors (almost mid developers): I know 2, 3.200.000 and 2.800.000 -plus stock options and cash bonuses which puts them at similar level with the seniors in other tech companies in Costa Rica


## Final thoughts

Before heading out I want to thank my friends.

Life takes a lot of twists. When I was in high school I was the best student, going out in TV interviews, having Informe11 in my home once (no Galán tho :( ), getting a lot of prices, killing it in exams with no effort. Some of my friends I think genuinely appreciated that, and some needed my help in projects and exams.

Now, I'm the guy asking all of my friends for help, guys that could perfectly be my bosses this day. They're all doing pretty well for themselves and they helped me reach the rigth people multiple times and gave me lots of insights as to what their companies and journeys have been like.  

God bless you lads!

Anyway, **I'm not going home any time soon :(**. I mentioned at the top that I was actually starting a new job. I'm having a lot of fun in my hedge fund job.

But Costa Rica doesn't work for me yet. I knew that it was going to be hard, and that it will hit in many ways to return. It's gonna have to be a very well architected project. 

The important thing is to get closer and closer to knowing the rules of the game.
