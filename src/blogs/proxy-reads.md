## Proxy Reads

Every developer has to find a way to stay up to date. We all have different interests, different preferred media, and we all can stand different amounts of density when reading. Very few people I know actually go heavy into research papers for example. There's a lot of information out there, and it's hard to find a way to systematically be up to date using sources you enjoy. 

Sometimes you just want to stay productive and that can be done in many ways, especially since there are tons of different directions in which we can grow. 

The below can serve you not only when (A) you want to learn something new and want to dedicate a few evenings to it, but also (B) for when you only have 5-10 minutes to read while you're bored at work, or 30 min to an hour to listen to a podcast while driving or at the gym.

I may not be a great resource myself yet, but I do feel I have already built my set sources to always go back to. Below I list a few in **ascending order of preferredness :)** Basically, this an effort to curate some content sources (**not topics**) for you, similar to how newsletters do curate content on a daily basis. I can't summarize you the content, so I'll call these **proxy reads**.

### Technical stuff

#### Medium

Medium is a very famous blogging site. Everybody can post on anything, and just like youtube/instagram/tiktok it's full of creators and can become very comercial. That means two things:

1. Most blogposts are quick light reads. You gotta keep people entertained.
1. It's full of trash. So you gotta learn how not to fall prey of just clickbait.

But once you get a feeling for the tone of the reads and the stuff in there, you'll see that it both can get very **entertaining**, and very **educational**. It's funny that sometimes I get to these posts by googling stuff where I would expect the answer to be in Reddit or StackOverflow instead.

I use Medium mostly for personal finance reading, and for software engineering topics. I've noticed I've already got a feeling for the good posts when it comes to those topics. 

There's a paywall. I think like 6 pounds a month maybe? Totally worth it. This subscription, together with Spotify, are the only non negotiables in my budget. 

Here's a link to a few cool Medium sites:
1. [Better Programming](https://betterprogramming.pub)
2. [Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering)
3. [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com)

And few specific posts I've liked:
1. [Why we chose Java for our High-Frequency Trading application](https://medium.com/@jadsarmo/why-we-chose-java-for-our-high-frequency-trading-application-600f7c04da94)
1. [Study Plan to Land Senior Software Engineer Positions at Meta, Google, and More](https://medium.com/better-programming/study-plan-to-land-senior-software-engineer-positions-at-meta-google-and-more-cd5362dda84)
1. [System Design â€” Key Concepts and Terms [Interview Notes] ðŸ”¥](https://medium.com/@ganeshpr227/key-concepts-and-terms-of-system-design-interview-notes-9bf882cf3730)


#### Software Engineering Daily
 
This is a podcast. Most of the times I find it boring as fuck to be honest, but it's nonetheless a good resource. You'll see they've had hosts experts in all technologies, and from most companies. 

It has helped me when I had interviews and wanted to dig deeper in some system designs, or when I want to hear about new technologies that are trending, but that most likely I'll ever use. Like OAuth for example. It's been the one I've used the most to learn about Crypto actually.

(Side note: It's pretty technical, and it attracts very smart hosts. So if you're a pure software engineer you'll identify with the people they host.)

Search for Sofware Engineering Daily on Apple podcast or Spotify.

#### HackerNews

Hackernews was built, and it's maintained by **YCombinator**. It is like a Reddit. Users submit links to stories, and they're ranked based on a voting system. The higher a news is ranked, the more on the top it will come out in the newsfeed. 

So basically this is a way of seeing stories about technology, that other people are already deemed as good. So in a way, it's a highly curated source of news for you, by people that are just like you :).

#### StaffEng

A friend shared me this one recently and it's pretty great. It's so great that you'll notice I copied the colors and minimalism into my own site :)

It's a view into the types of Staff Engineers out there, what they do, how to get there, and you can also read the story of many of them. It has a podcast as well in case you're not fond of reading too much. 

A Staff Engineer is a pretty distiguished title. It's meant for an engineer that is able to produce a lot of impact without necessarily having to go into management. If you're a fan of tech, and you think coding and designing is where the fun's at, then it might be good for you to follow an Staff path.

#### Educative.io

[Post 1](/blog?post=aws-first-steps), and [Post 2](/blog?post=aws-first-insights) on AWS are based on courses I took in [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/) so if you read those and clicked through you might be familiar with the site.

Educative.io is a site with lots of educational courses. It's like an Udemy, but with 3 main caveats:

1. You can pay a yearly subscription and get access to EVERYTHING, rather than having to pay course by course.
2. The courses allow little sandboxes where you code and run the code in place. So it's more interactive than simply reading or watching a video.
3. The content is just way better. I think almost anyone can post a course in UDEMY and sell it. Not in Educative.io. It's all similarly branded and you won't find repetitions of courses because two or three random people posted the same course and they're coercing you into buying the cheapest.

So overall it's a lot more quality and breath than anything out there.

There's a lot of range. From Theoretical courses, to Machine Learning, to Cloud, to Project Management, to how to learn programming languages, to interviewing, ... 

I was in a bookstore recently, and almost bought this O'Reilly book on Domain-Driven design for Â£55. But before that, I went on Educative and found basically that content there. It might be better, or worse, but definitely worth a try before paying 55 quid. What it's for sure though, is that the content will be good, and that reading from a structured webiste with links and images is a lot better for most people than reading from a textbook.

So far I've used it to study for:

1. [Data structures and algorithms for interviewing](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
2. [System design for interviewing](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview)
3. Learning [Typescript](https://www.educative.io/path/typescript-for-front-end-developers)
4. [The basics of AWS](https://www.educative.io/courses/good-parts-of-aws)
5. And now will jump into [Domain Driven Design](https://www.educative.io/courses/domain-driven-design). 

It's not cheap, but it's education and it's worth it. If you want to try it for a bit, you can reach out to me and we can see what we can do ;)

#### TLDR (newsletter)

This is a recent newsletter I subscribed to. You probably already get tons of emails from newsletters you subscribed in the past thinking you'd read them. But you never did. Like the Morning Brew for most of us.

This newsletter actually includes software engineering. All others are about tech as a whole and startups, but that's not that deep and I've found that hard to really engage with.

This one I've used it for a couple of weeks with a lot more success. Disclaimer: I call success to reading 2 out of 15 stories they send a day.

Have a look at the last one [here](https://actions.tldrnewsletter.com/web-version?ep=1&lc=73005155-1f3e-11ed-9258-0241b9615763&p=1597592f-2f52-11ed-9a32-0241b9615763&pt=campaign&t=1662633625&s=52401cf3cb059831a00046396fe27fe179c514cf3e32f07236ce409c7ec6d04d). I recommend reading the story on **Github Copilot**.

#### The Passionate Programmer

This is a new book I'm currently reading. It's like a guide for how to have an excepcional career in technology. It's inspiring to some extent, but more than anything helps you become a lot more intentional with your career.

It consists of 5 chapters that walk you through:
1. how to identify a market for yourself
2. invest in your product
3. execute well
4. sell your good work
5. and then maintaining yourself at the top. 
 
Each chapter has like 6 or 7 tips with a series of exercises at the end. 

I'm only half way through the second chapter, but the reading and the exercises are pretty insightful. And I'd totally recommend it. 

Overall, so far I've found it usefull to help me think about the market, where I'm at and where things are going. And how to tackle those gaps that can help me grow as both a generalist and a specialist.

Also it reinforces this vision I've picked up from my bosses and the industry I'm, which is that coding is kind of a commodity and that we need to grow in many different directions. So how do we take risks, and stay holistically on top?

[The passionate programmer on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6399113-the-passionate-programmer).

Shhhhh, I like books in physical to take notes, but you can download the book for free [here](https://github.com/media-lib/prog_lib/blob/master/general/Chad%20Fowler%20-%20The%20Passionate%20Programmer,%202nd%20edition.pdf).

### Range

The below are two of my favorites sources for range. What do I mean by Range? People that are in the technology space mostly, but their brains and involvement has long expanded way beyond that, and they're influencial in all ways. Sometimes they lie on the low, some other times they're in the spotlight. 

Sometimes the most valuable thing we can access to is the brain of great people. We cannot replicate Steve jobs' inventions, but we can try to follow his thought process for example.  

Range is also a great quality to attain if you're intellectualy curious. It's tought, because for most of us it won't translate into money and success directly, but I'll leave you this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ2_BwqcFsc) on the book *Range* by *David Epstein* (it's a 10 out of 10).. I recommend looking at his TedX videos if you're curious.


#### Paul Graham 

Paul Graham is a co-founder of YCombinator. An accelerator I speak briefly about in the [Wall-It post](/blog?post=wall-it). Paul is obviously very successful, influential, and a strong thinker. His writting is in the form of essays rather than blogging. So you'll see how his thoughts are a lot more structured and dense.

A friend of mine is constantly sharing me his essays. He finds him inspiring, and honestly so does the rest of the industry. His site [paulgraham.com](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) is about lots of things, but he touches on social issues, startups, technology, life, ...

Anyway, this is a highly intellectual person, with technically a "low profile", so it's hard to dislike.

These are some of the last essays I've read, and the most impressive thing is that they're OLD! Like 2004 kind of old, **yet they pass the test of time.**

1. [The Python Paradox](http://paulgraham.com/pypar.html)
1. [How people get rich now](http://paulgraham.com/richnow.html)
1. [How to work hard](http://paulgraham.com/hwh.html)
1. [Let the other 95% in](http://paulgraham.com/95.html)

#### All-In Podcast

The all-in podcast is four dudes chatting and talking crap about tech, business, politics, society, etc. Who are these dudes? Well they are very successfull entrepreneus, and now VC investors. They're all very well connected accross the VC and the tech world.

1. Chamath Palihapitiya. He became famous with Social Capital, and with Facebook. (If you're in finance, you might know Chamath because he is the one that created the SPACs :)) 
1. Jason Calacanis. Few startups, then successful investor.
2. David Sacks. Paypal guy that became rich together with Elon Musk. Then invested in Facebook, Uber, SpaceX, Palantir, Airbnb.
3. David Frieberg. He's an inventor, but also was an early employee in Google. He focuses on startups related to food, decarbonization, and life sciences.

Contrary to Paul Graham's site, this pod is all about the recent news of the week or what's going on in the world right now. Some of the things I can remember that they've recently taken on are: Twitter's deal, housing laws in California, McDonalds' pay rise, Softbank, Adam Neumann's new startup, Inflation, China vs the US, Pelosi visiting Taiwan, the FBI intruding in Trump's mansion, the crash in public markets, Crypto crash, Apple firing employees because of political correctness, etc...

There's a new episode every weekend and from the above I guess you can gauge the range of topics.

They're smart, opinionated, articulate, elocuent, sharp, but also friends with each other. So I find it to be an entertaining pod, with an insight as to how billionaires are thinking and chatting with each other without that many filters. Sometimes it even turns politically incorrect, which many of you will find that to be a pro. 

The [All-In Pod](https://www.allinpodcast.co). Search for it as "All-in" in Apple Podcasts, and Spotify.

### Leaving thoughts

Staying up to date in tech is beyond impossible. The pace of innovation is overwhelming, and most people have **given up**. But there are ways to give up.

You can give up, go away from the field or let your boss tell you what technology direction to take.

Or you can give up, by simply not letting yourself get overwhelmed and enjoy the process of just knowing a bit more of something. Even if you know you'll never get as far as it's possible.
