## Mo-Money manifesto
 
October 23, 2022

There are a lot of personal finance apps out there. Most of them focus on budgeting, tracking expenses, analytics on your spending habits, financial information, and investing. They connect to your bank accounts and do really smart things with the information they can read from your transactions. They see where you spent, how much you spent, in which categories, and how close you are to your limits.
 
However, there's none (that I have found) that helps you calculate and see the impact of what you **do NOT** spend.
 
Financial gurus would tell you to delay gratification, and save and invest by avoiding buying coffee from the shops on a daily basis, or avoiding the avocado toast, or not buying those shoes you don't need. But at the end of the day, we know that money that we **"save"** by not spending doesn't really end up being saved or invested. It just goes somewhere else.
 
And I believe the reason is twofold. First, it is hard to see the accumulated impact of all those individual delayed gratifications. And second, there's nothing helping us act immediately on them.
 
### Real $$$ Impact
 
What's the real impact of saying **No** to some of those things. Can we quantify it? Does it really accumulate to a number that's worth depriving us from that instant gratification?
 
The NHS helps calculate how much money a smoker spends on cigarettes, which simultaneously is how much money that person would save if they stopped smoking. See it here: [Calculate my savings](https://www.nhsinform.scot/stopping-smoking/calculate-my-savings). Somebody that has been smoking 8 cigarettes a day spends about £1460.00 per year on cigarettes.

Is £1,400 enough money to motivate you to reduce your consumption? Maybe.
 
But if not, what if you could add it to the impact of reducing consumption from other habits as well? Like less coffees from the coffee shops, one less meal a week from Deliveroo, ...? It's hard to know without measuring it, and for that we need to track it throughout time.
 
For some of us, there's certain satisfaction that comes when we know we managed to delay gratification. Even if it's small. A lot of apps on our phones tell us everything we need to know about our spending. But besides hitting our budgeting limits, there's nothing that celebrates all those victories that came from saying no to certain things.
 
I believe it will be very powerful to see the accumulated impact of all those little efforts on a screen.

### Pay yourself first, and throughout the month
 
But is there something else to this? Based on the NHS link above, if you hadn't been smoking for 20 years you could have a nice little Audi. My father stopped smoking 30 years ago. Does he have an Audi? **Nope**.
 
My parents have been very wise with their money. But for most of us, the money we save in these little situations just ends up being redirected to... some other situations. At times good investments, at other times not.
 
MoMoney will show you how much you're saving, it'll give you a nice number on the screen of your phone. Why let the number on the screen be just a number on your screen? Why not try to materialize on that saving?
 
Do you know the principle of *"pay yourself first."*? It states that you should have a system that always makes one or two automatic transactions at the beginning of the month. A specific amount of money in your checking account flows straight to your savings or investments account, so that you only spend after you have saved and/or invested for that month.
 
But, why only pay yourself first? If you can pay yourself all throughout the month?
 
How about the moment you pull out the MoMoney app to log that you just refrained from spending £3.5 in a cappuccino, you could also do a tiny transaction that posts the £3.5 directly to your savings account? Either through a bank transfer, or through a card payment.
 
### The App

All we need is a very simple app, where all you do is mark an entry anytime you say no to something.

#### Tracking potential savings

How to track the **real $$$ impact** of our delayed gratification?:

1. I passed by the coffee shop this morning on my way to the office. I didn't buy a coffee. Let me pull out my phone and log the entry.
2. Went to Zara this weekend and saw a nice shirt. But I have too many. Usually I would have bought it. But not this time. Pull out the phone and log the £40 saved.
3. I fell sick this week and unfortunately couldn't meet a friend for beers. Log that £20 pounds you didn't have to spend.
 
There is an obvious friction component here: it's not automatic, people have to manually input the *nope'd transactions.* **But that's only because there were no transactions at all, and this whole business is about trying to measure the invisible.** (Our best bet at removing the friction is using Siri's voice shortcuts.)

#### Materializing savings

How to materialize on the savings?:

1. Whenever the user does any of the actions above, allow to make a transaction through card or bank transfer from one account into another. (OpenAPI baby)

#### What questions should MoMoney answer?
 
1. How much I've saved this month/year/week/last week/custom period?
2. Can I see a list of all the "nope transactions" (transactions I avoided doing) for a particular period?
3. What is the category of spending where I have saved the most by refraining from spending?
4. Which days of the week do I save the most/least?
5. Which months of the year do I save the most/least?
6. How much money have I materialized directly into my savings account through MoMoney?


#### Monetization

Part of me just wants to build a very good app. And if so, we can avoid having to do ugly things like ads. If we build a very good app we can do a subscription model, like most other personal finance apps. 

Freemiun: 
1. Logging transactions will be free. 
2. Seeing the aggregated savings in any period will be free.

Premium ($3/month or $30/year):
1. Seeing a list of the logged transactions
2. Analytics
3. Transfer the saved amount directly to your savings account.

Whether the economics of this make sense or not will be a question for later. For now it can be a nice project if structured well and built progressively. 

A 50 day project?
