I'm in an airport doing a 12 hour layover in my way to Costa Rica. Have done already 6 hours and have 6 to go, I thought I could easily deal with sleeping in the floor and walking around the airport for so long. It was a mis-calculation to say the least.

Have you ever tried sleeping on the floor at 2 am in a non-tropical country? Not only your bones, and muscles, and neck resent it, but the coldness in general just goes through your skin and doesn't let you sleep. 

I'm so cold I decide to abandon the effort of sleeping, and just winging the busy social agenda I have for the next few days without any sleep. I need to start walking to warm up.

Finally find a Dunkin Donuts open and just as I put out my phone to pay, I see one of those notifications of terror: *"The British Pound is at its lower level since 37 years ago".* I was freezing so bad that I just laughed, had a bigger immediate problem. This one issue about money I had it in the back of my head all these months, I just wonder how worse it could keep going until it doesn't anymore.

In case you don't know, everything is crashing. We are all loosing on two different fronts: 1) the value of our assets is collapsing (stocks, bonds, real estate, you name it), and 2) inflation is dragging away the value of whatever is left.

A year or so ago, the Pound was at 1.4 and now it's a 1.13. Adding up to my severed roller coaster of wins and losses for the past 2 years. Now I'm at a big time low. 

So I felt I had 6 hours now to revise that thought I had a year or so ago, when the last Crypto crash gave me the greatest punch in the stomach I've ever had. 

### Crypto Crash

I had the luck of investing in Bitcoin in March 2020, right before the last *halving*. If I ever had any hopes of going back to university, given its costs in the US and the UK, I needed a strike of luck. No Sheik to the rescue this time like in Abu Dhabi for my bachelors.

An investment of $13,000 into bitcoin was that strike of luck. I didn't know what I was doing, but two things were certain: 1) $13,000 although a lot of money, it's not life changing money so I could afford to lose it all. And then 2) crypto was that kind of crazy thing that could fuel up like mofo! and grow into enough money I could use to pay for tuition.

The crypto rage of a couple of months after, plus further investments from my end lead me to hold **almost** $100,000 worth of crypto money. 

I told myself if I get to 100k I sell everything. The portfolio was at $97,000 when Elon twitted at midnight London time. I was awake, and started liquidating a bit, and then took two more days to fully liquidate till comfortable. But by then it all had gone down from $97k to $30k.

Taking a loss like that felt like loosing 3 years worth of savings or 3 years worth fo your life in a way. Finally understood what people mean when they say: **you must have stomach to do things like that**. Bike rides became my refuge, cycling through central and west London it's inspiring. Thought to myself that the people living in those fancy places had probably lost it all at some point and have came up even stronger.

But the worst part was that even if I grew psycologically, I was still the same Cristian. It's not that I spent that money on education and I could call myself a masters', or on a startup that failed and I could call myself a founder. 

### To Have

Movements like F.I.R.E. (Financial Independence Retire Early) put a lot of focus on your expenses and how you manage with what you have. Which is great as it's probably the first thing you gotta learn as an adult. 

However, once you form the habits and open your mind to it, that's it. It's not much bigger.

And these kinds of mentality of accumulating because compounding will do magic, or whatever, put a lot of emphasis in **having**.

Add to that the fact that software engineers at least, start making a lot of money rather young in comparison, and with not that much effort. Which makes us entitled to think we're better than we really are, and worst, that we deserve more than we have.

#### Admiration?

Having also has another problem. It doesn't command admiration by itself. 

Do you really admire 23 year old Crypto millionaires in Dubai just because they got in early?

Do you really admire 50 year olds that have a lot of disposable income because they have a lot of properties to rent?

I mean these are very admirable positions to be in, and they probably required a lot of grit and consistency. But you kind of admire more the way they live and what they can do with their lives, than what they themselves really are. Which is weird because in order to get there it requires a massive set of skills and discipline.  

It would be very hard to retire at 45 by simply being a software engineer that invested well and was opportunisitc enought. Yet, even if it'd difficult and I'd be lucky to achieve it, will I really feel content? 

Focusing on having can bring lots of benefits, but I'm afraid it could create a massive gap between my portfolio's earnings, and my own personal earning potential in the future.

It's important to put youself in positions where you as a normal person have a chance of winning, of beating inflation. But that can be done rather quickly, with a system, that won't push you for growth for too long. 

#### Having is out of your control

You can lose it all any time. 

Some people in tech in the valey have seen their stocks go down 70% in the past months. Not only their wealth went down, but also their salaries becuase they're heavily reliant on stock compensation.

I don't work in tech, nor get paid in stock. But I have seen my wealth go down massively, because of exchange rates, unexpected tax bills, inflation, public market valuation, my ex-employer's performance ... 

Yes, it's worth the risk to put yourself out there, out of your control (in a way). You might be thinking: *well you can do risk management, you were probably an idiot*. To which I say yes, but tell that to all the hedge fund managers that have gone down massively and have had to pick themselves up again with the trust of whoever investors held the line. Or successfull business people and professionals in Ukraine where all of a sudden it's better to flee and leave everything behind.  


### To Be

So my wealth goes up and down and it's out of my control most of the times. But even if I did good, had some luck, and etc. Am I really any better? 

No. And that's what partially why the gut puch of the cypto crash felt so bad.

Whether I was winning or loosing, I knew it all came down to having one good or bad idea. Not because I was a professional investor from which these are the usual. 

Doctors have to study a lot and pay expensive education fees, but they get themselves to be called doctors and then specialists for the rest of their lives. And that's a ticket to success. Follow a system together with a;; the other specialists, pay the price, and then a life of wealth, trips, cars, etc is sorted (at least from what I've seen of the system in Costa Rica).

So it's basically follow the system that although not easy, it's straightforward with no room for getting lost in options and indecission, then ride on heard mentality, and you're guaranteed riches.

Sometimes I wish I knew that earlier, although I would've gone into it as an easy way to make money so not the right reasons.

Anyway, I took inspiration from them plus the crash to be like: *Well, maybe I really should go do that MBA in the U.S. whatever the cost.* 

However, seems that the MBA is not anymore that guaranteed path to riches that the medicine specialist degree gives. It's more of a high risk bet given the cost.

And we have people like Elon Musk, and Warren Buffet going around saying that they don't like MBAs. Most of my bosses prefer good people over highly educated ones. Then how do we reconcile that?

Follow a traditional route that would increase my value as a highly educated professional, and that's the kind of stuff that took me where I am today. But likely won't be what takes me further in my career.

### To Do

Some people I really admire (like Tony, my flatmate) are turning to other types of projects and experiences to get the MBA experience done in their own ways.

Waive the fees, get something bigger out of it in they way. Like founding a startup or a non-profit.

This is just an example. But where I'm going is that doing can be even more important to do and be able to do, than to just be.

And I say that because that's what I've been lacking all these time. I have good ideas, I'm smart, I'm capable, with much a better CV than most people, but I don't act. I've turned into a **thinker**, cause that's some level of mental masturbation that I feel comfortable with and that fills my ego. 

And that has led me to my ideas being stolen by **doers**. And these type of people are just flying next to me, and leaving me way behind.

Not **doing** also affects your growth in the **being** category as well. You don't really become someone else unless you grow through the experiences. You'll never *be* a good writer, if you *don't do* the writting for sufficient hours. 

Furthermore, Doing is crucial for people that find themselves **lost** through life. It's the only thing that will ever get me closer to really finding a calling using myself as an example. 

There are only a finite amount of **positive** things you can think on your own with the information you have. The world is too big for you to believe that you should hold the answer within you, and that by simply thinking you'll reach it.

Even if you have the answer within you, it's tough to distinguish whether it's my heart, my gut, fear, or rationale the one talking. 

### Leaving thoughts

I think you should be willing to let go of the having in benefit of the being and doing. Specially at our age. The benefit of that portfolio compounding for years will not outweight the growth that could come from simply investing time and money into knowing yourself better and taking risks. 

You might end up with less money thought. Another reason as to why I didn't book a hotel tonight and chose to spend 12 hours in the cold airport. 

Those are the kind of luxuries I need to learn to live without, because you never know when you'll have to give them away in exchange for growing in your **being** and your **doing**.
